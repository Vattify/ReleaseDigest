# ReleaseDigest
The Release Digest is a program that accesses a database of software deployments (sensitive-information removed for privacy) and utilizes a search query that narrows down the results between two time periods to be exported into an outside document to be made into a digest of releases during that set period of time.

This was a project done within a two week time period during my internship at MediaMath, an adtech company. 
More information on the company found here: http://www.mediamath.com

GoogleSlides Presentation on the project found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y3MEk2HhuLUwzgX2bCQui_q0Mum4mlquw9owxAKU3-I/edit?usp=sharing

Included in this repository are the Javascript/JSON files created for the project, however due to it using an internal-tool called Heath and the removal of any sensitive information to the company, such as usernames and passwords, the program will not run. More information on Heath and the project can be found on the googleslides document above.

Also Included in this repository is a vidoe-demo of the project running

Thank you!
